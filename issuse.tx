1.give option to remove image from updating category (remove button for each image file), 
if user remove a image by pressing the delete button delete image from the server. 
other wise in current system if I uploaded an image wile creating a category it can not be removable 
by using update option

2. Gurd any names and slug must not contain dot (.) because we are using product , category, advertisement names for 
associated image name with a dot extenstion, so if a name contain dot operation it will conflict on image name and extension generating
